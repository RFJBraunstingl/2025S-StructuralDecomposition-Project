# 2025S Structural Decomposition and Algorithms

Goal of this repo is to implement an algorithm to calculate the minimum dominating set of a graph by utilizing dynamic
programming on tree decompositions of graphs.  

Tree compositions are obtained by [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) (which implements a heuristical approach using min-fill).

For the algorithm implementation see `min-dominating-set.py`.
